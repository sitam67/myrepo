*Jenkins vs Octopus*

- Jenkins is an extendable, open-source continuous integration server. You can use Jenkins to compile and test your code,
 and then have it trigger deployments in Octopus Deploy.

- Just like Jenkins makes build automation easy, Octopus Deploy makes deployment automation easy. 
Where Jenkins is designed to run a given build on a single build server, 
Octopus can deploy to hundreds of machines in parallel.

- Jenkins builds the code and runs tests, while Octopus takes care of:

>> Distributing applications to all the remote machines, securely
>> Environment-specific configuration, like connection strings
>> Configuring IIS and Tomcat sites and installing Windows Services
>> Doing all of the above across many machines in paralle
